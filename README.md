LibreHealth EHR is a free and open-source electronic health records and medical practice management application.

The mission of LibreHealth is to help provide high quality medical care to all people, regardless of race, socioeconomic status, or geographic location, by providing medical practices and clinics across the globe access to free of charge medical software. That same software is designed to save clinics both time and money, which gives practitioners more time to spend with individual patients, thereby supplying patients with higher quality care.

We are current and former contributors to OpenEMR and thank that community for years of hard work. We intend to honor that legacy by allowing this new community to leverage the good things in OpenEMR, share what we create and not be afraid to break backward compatibility in the name of forward progress and modern development models.

We are collaborating closely with the [LibreHealth Project](http://librehealth.io), an umbrella organization for health IT projects with similar goals.

`npm run dev` OR `yarn run dev`
 
For live building of components while developing, you can run

`npm run watch` OR `npm run watch-poll`
 

Run the default laravel server

## Change log  
  
Please see the [changelog](changelog.md) for more information on what has changed recently.  
  
## Testing  

Testing is very essential as this helps us to avoid bad practices and breaking code.
To test the application, ensure to have the test env variables in the `.env.testing` file, if not create one using the
`cp .env.example .env.testing`

```
TEST_DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
TEST_DB_DATABASE=lh_ehr_testing
TEST_DB_USERNAME=root
TEST_DB_PASSWORD=
```

Create a database for testing. Here, we will be using mysql for our db test since it supports column dropping etc, 
You can use **pgsql**, if you like by changing the default connection `lh_ehr_testing` driver pgsql in the `config/database.php`.

By default, the test connection is added to the `phpunit.xml` file. Feel free to edit this if needed to suit your custom 
database connection by changing the `<env name="DB_CONNECTION" value="lh_ehr_testing"/>` to 
`<env name="DB_CONNECTION" value="custom_connection"/>`

Create the test database **(lh_ehr_test)** and re-migrate your data and seed using the following command
` php artisan migrate --database=lh_ehr_testing  `
` php artisan db:seed --database=lh_ehr_testing  `
    
Or fresh install `php artisan migrate:fresh --database=lh_ehr_test --seed`

  
Run the tests using:
``` bash  
$ composer test  
```
